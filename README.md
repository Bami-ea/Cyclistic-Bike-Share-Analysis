# Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Analysis
This project analyzes how **Cyclistic Bike-Share** members and casual riders used bikes in 2019, and suggests how the company can convert more casual riders into annual subscribers.

##  Project Overview

**Main Goal:**  
To explore the differences in riding behavior between **annual members** and **casual riders** — and to identify **data-driven opportunities** for Cyclistic to grow membership.

---

##  Research Questions

- How do members and casual riders differ in terms of ride duration, timing, and frequency?
- Which stations are most popular for each user type?
- Are there *loyal casual riders* whose behavior is similar to members?
- How can these insights help design **targeted conversion strategies**?

---

##  Tools & Technologies

- **R:** Data cleaning, outlier removal, data organization, `member-like casuals` analysis
- **SQL (MySQL):** Data storage, data organization, aggregated summaries
- **Tableau:** Interactive dashboards and visual storytelling
- **Google Sheets:** Geocoding station locations (Google Maps API)

---

##  Key Insights

 **Peak Hours & Days:**  
- Members dominate weekday commute hours (8 AM & 5 PM).  
- Casual riders prefer weekends and midday trips.

 **Ride Duration:**  
- Casual riders take longer trips on average (39.4 mins) vs. members (12.9 mins).

 **Seasonal Trends:**  
- Usage drops for both groups in winter, but some casuals continue riding.

 **Member-like Casuals:**  
- Identified **493 casual riders** whose behavior mirrors members — these are strong candidates for conversion.

 **Top Starting Stations:**  
- Casual riders mostly start at scenic, recreation-friendly locations; members cluster around commuter rail hubs, dense business districts, and live-work neighborhoods.
- ⁠⁠The pattern shows casuals are likely tourists & locals out for scenic, seasonal leisure rides, while members mostly use the service for daily commuting and last-mile connections between transit and workplaces.


---

##  Recommendations

- **Target “winter-riding casuals”** with personalized offers to become annual members.
- Promote memberships during seasonal drop-offs to convert loyal casuals.
- Focus marketing at the top casual starting stations.
- Offer incentives for longer rides to encourage habitual usage.
